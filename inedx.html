      <h1>Data Visualization Critique</h1>

      <h2>Authors</h2>
      <p>Nishit Grover and Jeremy Oosterbaan</p>
      
      <h2>Purpose of the Visualization</h2>
      <p>The purpose of the Virus Explorer visualization is to provide an interactive tool for learning about and classifying different types of viruses based on their characteristics<p>

         <p>With the Virus Explorer Click & Learn, students will gain a better understanding of viral diversity, the criteria that scientists use to classify viruses, and the global prevalence of viral infections. The Click & Learn includes 10 different types of viruses to explore: rabies, influenza A, HIV, Ebola, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), adenovirus, T7, papillomavirus, Zika, and coronavirus.
         </p>

         <p>Each virus is accompanied by background information, an interactive 3D composite model based on published structural information (which highlights the overall shape of the virus and some of the proteins that are key to the virus’s structure or transmission.), an illustration of the virus’s cross section (which provides additional information and shows the structure of the capsid), and a diagram of the virus’s replication cycle. The Click & Learn also includes an illustration of the relative sizes of the viruses, which provides an opportunity to discuss scale and units.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Data Description</h2>
      <p>The data consists of information about various viruses, including their structure, genome type, host type, transmission mechanism, and vaccine availability.</p>
      
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>The data was likely collected from scientific literature and databases on viruses. The visualization draws on expert knowledge to present this information in an accessible and engaging way. </p>
      
      <h2>Target Users</h2>
      <p>The primary users of this visualization are likely students, educators, and the general public who want to learn more about viruses and how they differ from one another. </p>
      
      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <p>Some key questions people may want to answer using this tool include:
         <ol>
            <li>What are the different structural components of a virus?</li>
         <li>How do viruses with different genome types (e.g. RNA vs DNA) differ?</li>
         <li>What types of hosts can different viruses infect?</li>
         <li>How are viruses transmitted between hosts?</li>
         <li>Which viruses have approved vaccines?</li>
         </ol>
         </p>
      
      <h2>Finding Answers</h2>
      <p>Users can find answers to these questions by exploring the different virus categories, selecting individual viruses, and examining their detailed profiles. The interactive 3D models and cross-section diagrams help visualize the virus structures.</p>
      
      <h2>Example Insights</h2>
      <p>Some example insights someone can arrive at using this tool are
         <ol>
            <li>Viruses can have very diverse structures, from simple capsids to complex enveloped particles.</li>
            <li>RNA viruses tend to have single-stranded genomes, while DNA viruses often have double-stranded genomes. </li>
            <li>Many viruses can infect multiple host types, such as both animals and plants.</li>
            <li>Some viruses, like influenza, are transmitted through the air, while others require direct contact or a vector. </li>   
            <li>Only a subset of known viruses have approved vaccines available</li>      
         </ol>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Effective Design Choices</h2>
      <p>The design choices that are effective include the clear categorization system, the interactive 3D models, and the detailed virus profiles. These features make the visualization engaging and informative for users.</p>
      
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>The main limitation of this design is that it is focused on providing an overview of virus characteristics rather than a deep dive into any specific virus or process. Users cannot, for example, track the full replication cycle of a virus or see dynamic visualizations of virus behavior.</p>
      
      <h2>Improvements</h2>
      <p>Some design choices that could be improved include adding more dynamic visualizations, incorporating real-time data on emerging viruses, and providing more opportunities for users to explore connections between different viruses</p>

      <h4>Overall, the Virus Explorer is an effective educational tool that leverages visualization to help users understand the diversity and characteristics of viruses in an accessible way.</h4>
