      <h1>Data Visualization Critique</h1>
      <h4>Visualization Link: <a href=" https://media.hhmi.org/biointeractive/click/virus-explorer/" class="visualization-link">Virus Explorer</a></h4> 

      <h2>Authors:</h2>
      <p>Nishit Grover and Jeremy Oosterbaan</p>
      
      <h2>Purpose of the Visualization</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>The purpose of the Virus Explorer visualization is to provide an interactive tool for learning about and classifying different types of viruses based on their characteristics</li>
         <li>With the Virus Explorer Click & Learn, students will gain a better understanding of viral diversity, the criteria that scientists use to classify viruses, and the global prevalence of viral infections. The Click & Learn includes 10 different types of viruses to explore: rabies, influenza A, HIV, Ebola, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), adenovirus, T7, papillomavirus, Zika, and coronavirus.</li>
         <li>Each virus is accompanied by background information, an interactive 3D composite model based on published structural information (which highlights the overall shape of the virus and some of the proteins that are key to the virus’s structure or transmission.), an illustration of the virus’s cross section (which provides additional information and shows the structure of the capsid), and a diagram of the virus’s replication cycle. The Click & Learn also includes an illustration of the relative sizes of the viruses, which provides an opportunity to discuss scale and units.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Description</h2>
      <p>The data consists of information about various viruses, including their structure, genome type, host type, transmission mechanism, and vaccine availability.</p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>The data used in the visualization likely came from trusted scientific sources and virus databases, ensuring the info is reliable. By tapping into virology experts, the visualization gives a thorough view of virus traits and adds helpful insights. Expertise in the field helps turn complex data into an easy-to-understand format, making learning enjoyable for everyone. With a mix of data and expert knowledge, the visualization becomes a handy tool for learning about viruses, empowering users to explore the topic with ease and confidence. </p>
      
      <h2>Target Users</h2>
      <p>The primary users of this visualization are likely students, educators, and the general public who want to learn more about viruses and how they differ from one another. </p>
      
      <h2>Key Questions</h2>
      <p>Some key questions people may want to answer using this tool include:
         <ol>
            <li>How does the presence or absence of an envelope impact the transmission and pathogenicity of different virus types?
               <img src="/images/img9.png" alt="Virus Explorer Visualization" class="visualization-image">
            </li>

         <li>How do viruses with different genome types (e.g. RNA vs DNA) differ?
            <img src="/images/img7.png" alt="Virus Explorer Visualization" class="visualization-image">
         </li>

         <li>What types of hosts can different viruses infect?
            <img src="/images/img5.png" alt="Virus Explorer Visualization" class="visualization-image">
         </li>

         <li>How are viruses transmitted between hosts?
            <img src="/images/img6.png" alt="Virus Explorer Visualization" class="visualization-image">
         </li>

         <li>How does vaccines work against viruses?
         <img src="/images/img4.png" alt="Virus Explorer Visualization" class="visualization-image"></li>
         </ol>
         </p>
      
      <h2>Finding Answers</h2>
      <p>Users can find answers to these questions by exploring the different virus categories, selecting individual viruses, and examining their detailed profiles. The interactive 3D models and cross-section diagrams help visualize the virus structures.</p>

      <h2>Example Insights</h2>
      <p>Some example insights someone can arrive at using this tool are
         <ol>
            <li>Viruses can have very diverse structures, from simple capsids to complex enveloped particles.</li>
            <li>RNA viruses tend to have single-stranded genomes, while DNA viruses often have double-stranded genomes. </li>
            <li>Many viruses can infect multiple host types, such as both animals and plants.</li>
            <li>Some viruses, like influenza, are transmitted through the air, while others require direct contact or a vector. </li>   
            <li>Only a subset of known viruses have approved vaccines available</li>      
         </ol>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Effective Design Choices</h2>
      <p>The design choices that are effective include the clear categorization system, the interactive 3D models, and the detailed virus profiles. These features make the visualization engaging and informative for users.</p>
      
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>The main limitation of this design is that it is focused on providing an overview of virus characteristics rather than a deep dive into any specific virus or process. Users cannot, for example, track the full replication cycle of a virus or see dynamic visualizations of virus behavior.</p>
      
      <h2>Improvements</h2>
      <p>
      <ol>
         <li>Limited interactivity in visualizing viral structures and processes:<br>
            While the resource provides 3D models of viruses that users can rotate and view from different angles, it lacks more advanced interactive visualizations or simulations to better illustrate complex processes like viral replication cycles, transmission mechanisms, and host cell interactions.<br><br>
            
            <span> Potential improvement: </span> Incorporate interactive simulations, animations, or dynamic visualizations that allow users to explore and manipulate representations of viral structures, replication processes, and interactions with host cells in an engaging and intuitive manner.</li>

         <li>Lack of customization and exploration tools:<br>
            The current implementation seems to offer a predefined set of viruses and information, without providing users with tools to customize the visualizations, explore specific aspects of interest, or compare different viruses or scenarios.<br><br>
            
         </span>Potential improvement: </span> Develop user-friendly tools and interfaces that enable users to select specific viruses, cellular components, or processes they want to visualize, and provide options to compare or overlay different visualizations for deeper exploration and analysis.</li>

         <li>Limited integration of data and visualizations:<br>
            While the resource provides visual representations of viral structures, it does not appear to integrate or visualize other relevant data, such as genomic information, epidemiological data, or host responses.<br><br>
           
         </span> Potential improvement:</span> Incorporate visualizations that integrate and represent various types of data related to viruses, such as genomic sequences, protein structures, transmission patterns, host responses, or other relevant information, to provide a more comprehensive and data-driven exploration experience.</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
